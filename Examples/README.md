# Automatic Music Transcription:
# Introduction:
This task deals with detecting the frequencies and onset times of all musical notes (specifically notes produced by a piano) in .mp3 files. This task will attempt to detect a combination of single notes being played and overlapping notes being played simultaneously.
# Dataset:
